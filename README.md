# Python Maze Game Challenge

## Overview
The Python Maze Game Challenge is a journey through the development, problem-solving, and enhancement of a simple terminal-based maze game. This project emphasizes not just the gameplay but the evolution of the game code from a basic implementation to a version that includes scoring and correct exit handling.

## Challenge Highlights
- **Initial State:** The game started as a basic maze navigator where the player moves through the maze to find an exit. The initial challenge was to create a functional game loop and maze generation logic.
- **Bug Identification:** Through testing, a critical bug was identified where the game would not properly end upon reaching the exit, resulting in an infinite loop.
- **Enhancements:** Added a scoring system for collecting items, enhancing the game's depth and providing additional goals for the player.

## Technical Journey
- **Bug Fixing:** Detailed explanation of how the infinite loop was identified and resolved, including the logic adjustments needed for proper game termination.
- **Scoring Integration:** Overview of integrating a scoring system, including code modifications to track and display the score based on item collection.
- **Final Touches:** Final adjustments to ensure a cohesive gameplay experience, including code optimizations and user interface improvements.

## How to Play
1. **Starting the Game:** Instructions on running the game from a terminal.
2. **Objectives:** Description of the game objectives, including maze navigation, item collection, and exit strategy.
3. **Controls:** Explanation of the game controls using the WASD keys for movement.

## Code Structure
- `pymaze.py`: The initial version of the game.
- `pymaze_with_score.py`: The game with added scoring functionality.
- `pymazed_fixed.py`: The final version of the game, with both enhancements and bug fixes.
